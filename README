dev_blind - a writable dev_flash mounter for PlayStation 3

Source code: https://github.com/jjolano/dev_blind


This program will mount a writable dev_flash into /dev_blind, which can be used by various PS3 FTP servers and file managers.

THIS WILL ENABLE WRITE ABILITY ON dev_flash, WHICH IS VITAL TO THE OPERATION OF THE PLAYSTATION 3 SOFTWARE.
Use this at your own risk.
